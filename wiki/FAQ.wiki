FAQ for prospector. Feel free to add any Fs, i will try to provide the As.

Q: Why just windows? 

A: No other machines here, so i can't compile linux or mac versions. however i can't see any reason why it shouldn't compile on a mac or linux system. So just get freebasic (http://www.freebasic.net/index.php/download) and compile prospector.bas in your src directory. If you run into any problems let me know, and also please if you had success. I also wouldn't mind uploading precompiled linux & mac versions here if i had them.  


Q: How do i equip stuff?

A: Your awayteam always uses the best stuff it can have and redistributes it to the living when someone should die. 


Q: What does a mining and laser drill do?

A: Both add a bonus to damage vs walls. To damage walls use the Fire command.


Q: What are cryo chambers good for?

A: cryogenic chambers provide easy storage for people, just hire the additional crewmen to fill them.
