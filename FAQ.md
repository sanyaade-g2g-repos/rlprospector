FAQ for prospector. Feel free to add any Fs, i will try to provide the As.

## General ##
**Q: What are the system requirements**

A: Being a roguelike, Prospector isnt using lots of resources. Current and not very old computers should be able to handle it without any problems.

## Basic howtos ##

**Q: What are the o o o thingies under my ship supposed to mean?**

A: It's the systems map. You can see the star, o are planets. â–‘ asteroid fields. Once you decide to scan or land a cursor appears there that lets you chose the planet. You can also put the systems map in an alternate position on the bar in options.

**Q: How do I get money?**

A: Explore stuff, and then walk into the company office at a space station, and sell the stuff

**Q: How do I get more air?**

A: Walk onto your ship.

**Q: How do I get biodata?**

A: (I)nspect plants and corpses. Not all plants and corpses yield results though

## Planets ##

**Q: I landed on this planet that is obviously bugged. Every tile is random and the crew speaks gibberish. Shall I report this bug?**

A: In this case actually no. It's supposed to be this way.
All other bugs of course please do report! Fixing them is so much easier when you know where they are!

## Items ##

**Q: How do i equip stuff?**

A: Your awayteam always uses the best equipment they can have and redistributes it to the living when someone should die.

**Q: Why does that gun/armor/knife have a `*` in front of it?**

A: That item is tied to that crew member. Unless he is dead he grabs it before any normal Item distribution takes place. You can set and clear it in the (A)wayteam screen. Possible uses would be to give your best gun to the sharp shooter, or your weakest armor to the guy with the most hitpoints.
**NOTE** The item selection doesnt distinguish if an item is bound to another crewmember already. If you assign the weapon again it will override the old assignment

**Q: What does a mining and laser drill do?**

A: Both add a bonus to damage vs walls. To damage walls use the Fire command.

**Q: What are cryo chambers good for?**

A: cryogenic chambers provide easy storage for people, just hire the additional crewmen to fill them.

**Q: What do portable sensor sets do?**

A: Increase viewing range on planets

**Q: How do I deploy rovers?**

A: Just drop them when you are on a planet. Collect them later for the Map data.

**Q: I just bought 15 binoculars and 3 Helmet lamps and i still don't see any better**

A: They don't stack, you only need one

**Q: I bought a jetpack, yet i can't fly**

A: You need one jetpack for every member of your awayteam. Hoverplattforms you need one for every 5 awayteam members

**Q: I bought 3 aux oxygen tanks /12 aux jetpackfuel tanks, and i still only have 200 Oxygen/50 Jetpackfuel**

A: As of 0.1.9 They do stack, but each crew member can only carry one.

## Radio Commands ##
**Q: What are the commands for (R)adioing the ship**

A: One is "Hello" wich is answered with "Yes?" And more I will not tell you. Except that there are currently 10 (including the above).

**Q: Any hints?**

A: Your communications satellite can do more than just relay messages. 2 Commands are a bit redundant, one is suicidal and the remaining too aren't too practical, though they can be fun.

**Q: Anything else on radio commands?**

A: There are 3 commands if you got a rover on the planet: rover start, rover stop and rover target.

## Other things ##
**Q: The stations don't let me dock and shoot at me! What shall I do?**

A: Kill some pirates until they like you again. Or try to find a pirate base. They might be friendly if they see you as a fellow pirate.

**Q: What does start easy do?**

A: If the start easy option is activated Pirates won't start any fleets for the first 100 turns, also monsters will have fewer hitpoints, their hitpoints will get divided by 500/turncount, letting them have their normal HPs by turn 500.

**Q: How can we contact you?**

A: comments, questions, ideas, feedback, bugreports, praise, criticism etc you can send to
